Hello Team,

I hope you're all having a pleasant evening.

As previously discussed, I have made updates to my GitHub repository and included a comprehensive README.md file. This README provides a step-by-step guide on how to run the project and lists the prerequisites required for it. Additionally, I kindly request you to create a .env file and populate it with the provided credentials, as outlined in the README.md file.

You can find the GitHub repository link below:

Thank you for your attention.

Best regards,
Sanket Khule
